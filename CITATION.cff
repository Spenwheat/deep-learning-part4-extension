  The official Deep Learning book ends at Part III, Chapter 20. 
  This unofficial companion proposes a Part IV â€” extending the text into frontier topics 
  such as Variational Inference, Transformers, Diffusion Models, Multimodal & Foundation Models, 
  and Future Directions. Created during independent study and AI prototyping, shared to support learners.
