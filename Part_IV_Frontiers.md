## Chapter 21 — Factor Models Revisited

**Motivation.** Classical factor models such as *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*, *Independent Component Analysis (ICA)*, and *Factor Analysis* explain \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) via latents \(z\in\mathbb{R}^k\), \(k\ll d\). Linearity and Gaussianity limit expressiveness.

**Core idea.** Nonlinear factors via neural mappings:
- Encoder \(z=f_\theta(x)\), decoder \(x'\!=g_\phi(z)\).
- Role-specialized latents (Predictor, Critic, Hedger, Sentinel) act as interpretable factors.
- Gating network \( \alpha(x)\in\Delta^m \) (simplex) mixes role outputs.
- Regularizers: Kullback–Leibler (KL) terms, mutual information penalties, covariance off-diagonal penalties.

**Benefits.** Interpretable axes; modularity; swap/compose roles.

**Trade-offs.** Exact disentanglement is hard; over-regularization hurts fit.

**Example.** Macro indicators → β-Variational Autoencoder (β-VAE) recovers nonlinear “cycle vs. trend” factors that PCA blurs.

## Chapter 22 — Autoencoders, Variants, and Extensions

**Motivation.** Plain autoencoders minimize \(\|x-g_\phi(f_\theta(x))\|^2\) but lack robustness/generative semantics.

**Core variants.**
- **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE):** train on noisy \(\tilde x\sim q(\tilde x|x)\) to reconstruct \(x\).
- **Sparse Autoencoder:** encourage low activation via KL\((\hat\rho\|\rho)\).
- **Contractive Autoencoder:** penalize \(\|\nabla_x f_\theta(x)\|_F^2\) to enforce local invariance.
- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE):** optimize  
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \mathrm{KL}(q_\phi(z|x)\,\|\,p(z)).
  \]
- **Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE):** discriminator matches \(q(z)\) to \(p(z)\).

**Benefits.** Robust representations (DAE), generative latents (VAE/AAE), unsupervised pretraining.

**Trade-offs.** VAEs can be blurry under Gaussian likelihoods; strong sparsity/contraction may discard detail.

**Example.** Industrial sensors → DAE flags anomalies when reconstruction error spikes.

## Chapter 23 — Advanced Representation Learning

**Motivation.** Good representations reduce sample complexity and improve transfer.

**Core techniques.**
- **Contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, CLIP):** maximize agreement of positive pairs; InfoNCE loss.
- **Predictive coding (e.g., CPC, BERT):** predict masked/future parts from context.
- **Pretext tasks:** rotations, jigsaws, masked patches.

**Benefits.** Label-efficient transfer; broad invariances.

**Trade-offs.** Contrastive methods need large batches/negatives; excessive invariance may remove task-useful signal.

**Example.** CLIP aligns text–image pairs: “a red sports car” ↔ image → zero-shot retrieval/classification.

---

## Chapter 24 — Structured Probabilistic Models

**Motivation.** Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) give structure; deep nets give flexibility. Combine them.

**Core hybrids.**
- **Deep Bayesian Networks:** hierarchical latents with neural conditionals.
- **Deep Markov Models (DMMs):** latent dynamics + neural emissions.
- **Neural Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):** deep features for structured outputs.
- **Energy-Based Models (EBMs):** unnormalized \(E_\theta(x)\) trained by contrastive methods.

**Benefits.** Encodes domain priors (temporal, spatial, causal); improves interpretability.

**Trade-offs.** Inference is approximate (variational, Monte Carlo); training slows.

**Example.** Weather: latent dynamical models that respect physics while modeling nonlinearities.

---

## Chapter 25 — Advanced Monte Carlo and Variational Inference

**Motivation.** High-dimensional posteriors defeat naive sampling; variational families need flexibility.

**Core methods.**
- **Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS):** bridge \(p_0\to p_1\) via temperatures \(p_t\).
- **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC):** simulate Hamiltonian dynamics to make long proposals with high acceptance.
- **Particle Filters:** sequential Monte Carlo with resampling.
- **Normalizing Flows:** invertible \(z\mapsto x=f_\psi(z)\) to model complex posteriors/priors.
- **Amortized Variational Inference (AVI):** neural \(q_\phi(z|x)\) amortizes inference.

**Benefits.** Capture multimodality; scalable approximate inference.

**Trade-offs.** Compute-intensive; variance/bias management needed.

**Example.** Grid planning: AIS targets rare high-stress regimes rather than wasting samples elsewhere.

## Chapter 26 — Large-Scale Representation Learning

**Motivation.** Self-supervision at scale produced general-purpose features.

**Core paradigm.**
- **Masked prediction:** BERT (tokens), Masked Autoencoders (patches).
- **Next-token prediction:** GPT (autoregressive).
- **Contrastive objectives:** SimCLR/CLIP (views/modalities).

**Scaling laws.** Error often follows power laws in data/parameters/compute.

**Benefits.** Foundation models with strong zero/few-shot behavior; parameter-efficient adapters.

**Trade-offs.** Large compute/data; inherited dataset biases.

**Example.** GPT-style models adapted to economics Q&A with minimal labeled data.

---

## Chapter 27 — Attention and Transformers

**Motivation.** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) struggle with long dependencies; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) lack flexible global context.

**Core idea.** Scaled dot-product attention:
\[
\mathrm{Attn}(Q,K,V)=\mathrm{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V.
\]
Stack multi-head attention + feedforward + residual + normalization → **Transformer**.

**Benefits.** Parallelism; long-range modeling; cross-domain backbone (text/vision/audio).

**Trade-offs.** Quadratic time/memory in sequence length; attention weights not always faithful explanations.

**Example.** Transformers displaced RNNs in translation and then generalized to vision (Vision Transformers).

---

## Chapter 28 — Diffusion and Score-Based Models

**Motivation.** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be unstable; Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can be blurry. Diffusion offered stability + fidelity.

**Core idea.** Forward noising and learned reverse denoising:
\[
x_t=\sqrt{\alpha_t}\,x_{t-1}+\sqrt{1-\alpha_t}\,\epsilon,\quad \epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I).
\]
Learn \(\epsilon_\theta(x_t,t)\) (or score \(\nabla_x\log p_t(x)\)) to step back to \(x_0\).

**Benefits.** Stable training; state-of-the-art samples; flexible conditioning (text/class guidance).

**Trade-offs.** Slow sampling (hundreds of steps); high compute.

**Example.** Text-to-image systems (e.g., Stable Diffusion) synthesize high-fidelity images from prompts.

---

## Chapter 29 — Multimodal and Foundation Models

**Motivation.** Humans fuse modalities; AI needs unified representations.

**Core approaches.**
- **Contrastive alignment (CLIP):** paired text–image embeddings.
- **Multimodal Transformers:** shared attention over text/pixels/audio.
- **Adapters / Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** parameter-efficient specialization.

**Benefits.** Unified backbone; zero-shot/few-shot generalization; reuse across domains.

**Trade-offs.** Requires large aligned datasets; risk of shallow correlations.

**Example.** A single model captions images, answers questions about charts, and reasons over text.

---

## Chapter 30 — Future Directions

**Themes.**
- **Disentanglement & Causality:** latents that reflect causes, not correlations.
- **Efficiency:** sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE), quantization, distillation, on-device inference.
- **Uncertainty & Safety:** calibration, out-of-distribution detection, risk-aware objectives (e.g., CVaR).
- **Democratization:** federated/decentralized role-specialized networks (your distributed MoE vision).

**Benefits.** Accessible, robust, interpretable systems.

**Trade-offs.** Efficiency vs. expressiveness; decentralization vs. coordination/security.

**Example.** Federated healthcare: hospitals train locally, share only updates; privacy preserved, global model improves.
